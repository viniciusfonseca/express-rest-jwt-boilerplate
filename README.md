# REST Node App

This is a boilerplate app to make a REST app with Express. It uses Sequelize.js as ORM to manage data persistence. It also features register and login functionalities, brcypted password storage and a JWT validation middleware. This is intended for personal use (future projects), but feel free to fork or copy the source code for any kind of use.

Installation:

`npm install`

Running:

`node .`

The app should then listen to port 8000.
